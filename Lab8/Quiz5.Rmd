##Q1012   
a. `margin of error = 0.98/sqrt(1100) = 0.0295 約= 0.03`
```{r}
high.c = 0.47 + 0.03;high.c
low.c = 0.47 - 0.03;low.c
```

**[0.44, 0.5]**   

b. The interval computed in part(a) means that we are 95% sure that the actual percentage of American adults who favor the legalization of marijuana is between 44% And 50%.   

##Q1054
a.    
```{r}
prop.test(x = c(85, 24), n = c(1105, 1379), alternative = 'two.sided', conf.level = 0.95)
```

**[0.04154, 0.07749]**    

b. The interval computed in part(a) means that we are 95% sure that the true proportion of snorers who have a heart disease is between 0.0415 & 0.0775 higher than non-snorers who have a heart disease.   
On the basis of that, we can infer that the population proportions with heart disease **differ** for snorers and non-snorers.
