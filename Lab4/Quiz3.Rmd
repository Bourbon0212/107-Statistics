a. For a binomial distribution：   
mean = np   
sd = sqrt(np(1-p))    
```{r}
mean = 100 * 0.5
mean
sd = sqrt(100 * 0.5 * 0.5)
sd
```

b. P(>=60) by normal distribution approximation.    
```{r}
pnorm(60, mean = 50, sd = 5, lower.tail =  F)
```

c. P(>=59.5) by normal distribution approximation. 
```{r}
pnorm(59.5, mean = 50, sd = 5, lower.tail =  F)
```

d. P(>=60) by binomial function.    
```{r}
pbinom(59, size = 100, prob = 0.5, lower.tail = F)
```

e. For a binomial distribution, the most accurate value will be caculated by using `pbinom()`, which is (d.).   
On the other hand, the least accurate value will be caculated by using `pnorm()` without correction, which is (b.).
